FiveM repair vehicle id. 

With this script you can repair the vehicle 
from a player without actually going to the player. 

There is not much protection on it since they can just use 
the fivem natives in a lua executor if they would want so. 

This script requires the ESX framework feel free to convert to QBCore 
if you want.
